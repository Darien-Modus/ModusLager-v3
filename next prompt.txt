I must notice that today you are just making the files I didn't ask you to and making the changes I didn't ask you to.

Items Page. The vertical colour strip is not fixed, it is still all the way to the left, when it should be grouped with the icon image without padding, so that the icon would feel like a continuation of the colour strip in case the colour is chosen as an icon. No border. It should also be like 5-10 times thicker than it is now, like it used to be. I don't know what did you change, but it doesn't seem to be in the ItemsPage file since I tried to replace it with the old one, and it was still the same.

Add booking modal. This is a complete mess now. I don't want tags, I want the search to be a dropdown menu (works as a regular dropdown if you don't enter any values, but starts to narrow the options down when you start typing) while showing the icon of each item

Since we have more space in the item cards in the overview page, we could adjust the height of the card so that it matches the combined width of the strip+icon so that they together are in a form of a square.
